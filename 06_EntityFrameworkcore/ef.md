## Entity Framework 
Ef core is a complete rewrite of Ef, taking advantage of all the goodness that is .Net core. However, being a rewrite ,there wasn't time to recreate all the features in EF6 within the timeline of the release of .Net core 1.0.
The realeas of Ef core 1.1 brought more features from Ef6 online and introduced new features as well. while still not complete,it was complete enough for asp.net developers to start using in real projects.
